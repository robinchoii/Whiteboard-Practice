Q1 -  In a min-heap:
A - parent nodes have values greater than or equal to their childs
B - parent nodes have values less than or equal to their childs
C - both statements are true

In a min heap, parents always have lesser or equal values than that of their childs.

Q2 - push() and pop() functions are found in
A - queues
B - lists
C - stacks
D - trees
Answer : C
Explanation
Stack uses push() to insert an item in stack, and pop() to remove the top item from stack.

Q3  - Minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is
A - 2n2
B - 2n-1
C - 2n - 1
D - 2n - 1
Answer : C
Explanation
Minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n - 1. Where n is the number of disks. If the number of disks is 3, then minimum number of moves required are 23 - 1 = 7

Q 4 - If the array is already sorted, which of these algorithms will exhibit the best performance
A - Merge Sort
B - Insertion Sort
C - Quick Sort
D - Heap Sort
Answer : B
Explanation
Insertion sort, as it should then work in linear way.

Q 5 - After each iteration in bubble sort
A - at least one element is at its sorted position.
B - one less comparison is made in the next iteration.
C - Both A & B are true.
D  Neither A or B are true.
Answer : A
Explanation
In one iteration of Bubble sort, the maximum of the set in hand is moved at the end of the unsorted list. Hence one less comparison.

Q6 - What will be the running-time of Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm, if the graph G(V,E) is stored in form of adjacency list and binary heap is used −
A - Ο(|V|2)
B - Ο(|V| log |V|)
C - Ο(|E|+|V| log |V|)
D - None of these
Answer : B
Explanation
The runing time will be Ο(|E|+|V| log |V|) when we use adjacency list and binary heap.

Q8 - Recursion uses more memory space than iteration because
A - it uses stack instead of queue.
B - every recursive call has to be stored.
C - both A & B are true.
D - None of the above are true.
Answer : B
Explanation
Recursion uses stack but the main reason is, every recursive call needs to be stored separately in the memory.

10 - An adaptive sorting algorithm −
A - adapts to new computers.
B - takes advantage of already sorted elements.
C - takes input which is already sorted.
D - none of the above.
Answer : B
Explanation
A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already 'sorted' elements in the list that is to be sorted.
